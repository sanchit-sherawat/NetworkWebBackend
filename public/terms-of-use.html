							</ol>
							<ol start="4">
								<li><strong>DR FULFILLMENT TIME FRAME:</strong><br/>
								<p class="text-blue">NOTICE: We only accept DRs that can be fulfilled and will apply our best efforts to fulfill them as soon as possible. All DRs will be fulfilled on a <em><u>First-Come-First-Serve</u> </em>basis. We give a perspective and opinion on the matter of &ldquo;DR fulfillment&rdquo; at: VIRON.NETWORK. However, and again, due to common international regulations, <u>we cannot and</u> <u>do not guarantee &ldquo;specific&rdquo; DR Fulfillment time frames in any way, shape, or form</u>.</p>

							<ol start="5">

							<ol start="6">
							<li><strong>YOUR VIRON HOME-BUSINESS (VHB) OVERHEAD:</strong>
							<p>Importantly, your primary income, when achieved, will be generated through VIRON marketing &amp; powering the third-party MLM Company for you. You acknowledge and understand that your Business Overhead with the third-party MLM Company (monthly and/or annual fees) will start when you engage with VIRON and continue until your DRs order is fulfilled. However, VIRON cannot and does not make any claims about the ability of any third-party MLM Company to generate income in any specific amount or within a certain time frame.</p>

							<ol start="7">
							<li>VIRON services are engineered to assist the Individual achieve a higher probability of success in the Network Marketing Industry. We are not a &ldquo;<em>get rich quick scheme</em>&rdquo;. We do not guarantee success will be &ldquo;overnight&rdquo;. And past performance is not indicative of future results. However, on the positive side and potential, FYI: There are now over <strong>8 Billion people on Earth</strong>. <em>*Source:</em> <em><u>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population</u></em>. And we strongly feel that VIRON applies to many more people than just the approximate <strong>1 Million+</strong> people currently in the Network Marketing Industry. <em>*Source: Direct Selling</em> <em>Association (DSA) + ChatGPT. </em>Therefore, logically, we believe that with our Profound and Revolutionary Business Concept, Civic Vision, and VIRON.NETWORK&rsquo;s existence, more people will achieve more success in &ldquo;<em>MLM</em>&rdquo; than at any other time in the Network Marketing Industry. In our opinion, VIRON has the most upside potential for any individual.</li>

							<ol start="8">
							<li>All users of the VIRON.NETWORK website are subject to the <a href="service-agreement.html"><u>SERVICE AGREEMENT</u></a>.

							</ol>
							<ol start="10">
							<li class="text-blue">Again, due to regulations, we cannot guarantee that any DR will stay in your downline indefinitely, however, when you apply sound logic ::: <strong><em>as DR&rsquo;s in your Downline</em></strong> <strong><em>are placed, and their Downline and income grows</em></strong>&hellip; in our humble opinion, no one in their right mind would ever have any reason to &ldquo;quit&rdquo; or abandon the business.

							<p class="mb-0"><strong>Commissions</strong></p>
							<p>If applicable, you will receive compensation in accordance with VIRON&rsquo;s Compensation Plan &ldquo;VCP&rdquo;: <u>VIRON.NETWORK</u> from orders placed through your Affiliate Site (unless stated otherwise for a particular product).

							<p class="mb-0"><strong>Payment</strong></p>
							<p>All affiliate commission payments will be sent via whichever platform that VIRON deems to be the most efficient for VIRON Members.

							<p>VIRON will be solely responsible for processing every order placed by a customer on the Affiliate Site.

							<p class="mb-0"><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>

							<p class="mb-0"><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
							<p>Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.</p>
							<p>If any of the provisions of this Agreement are determined by a court to be unenforceable, they shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
